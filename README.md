# DigiRoller

## What is it?
The DigiRoller is a Pico Pi powered pocket digital die roller designed for D&D/Tabletop gaming. Use it to make a handfull of simple rolls, or to roll a ton of dice all at once. I am posting this project because what got me into it was seeing all the other neat things people make. I wanted to maybe help inspire someone to try something too.

## Things you will need
- A 3D printer for the case
- A pico pi (https://www.waveshare.com/raspberry-pi-pico.htm)
- A pico 1.3" screen (https://www.waveshare.com/pico-lcd-1.3.htm)
- A pico USP power supply (https://www.waveshare.com/pico-ups-b.htm, the li-po one)

## Steps
- Once you have the pico, follow the instructions to set up Thonny so you can move code onto the pico: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Pico
- Move the 2 included .py files from the Code folder onto the pico
- Plug the screen in, following the guide: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-LCD-1.3
- Plug the battery in, following the guide
- At this point, you should be able to unplug the Pico, turn on the UPS, and the battery roller code should work
- Now print the 3 case pieces.

## Print suggestions
I printed at a 0.2mm layer height. But each printer may have slightly different tolerances. You can use the Thingiverse Customizer for this project or the included OpenSCAD file to tweak the 'tolerance' settings.

## Final words
Good luck with the project!
